### Part 1 Preprocessing 
After loading the packages we'll need for the lesson we will do some data preprocessing.
To Begin the data needs to be downloaded/read in to R from the URL provided (Tip: You can change this destination for your own data)
Here we can also make the design object (The thing that indicates condition/cell-type etc. of each sample)

### Part 2 DESeq2 and PCA plot
Next we will perform some preliminary data visualisation to get a feel for the dataset we have.
For more information on PCA see: [Huub and Marc's PCA Lesson](https://github.com/ScienceParkStudyGroup/studyGroup/tree/gh-pages/lessons/20190124_PCA_Huub_Marc)
