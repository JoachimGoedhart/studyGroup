 - **Authors**: Franka van der Linden (PhD Molecular Cytology)
 - **Lesson Topic**: What computing topics does this lesson cover?



## Description
This lesson will cover basic principles on how to write your own macro in ImageJ. We will first discuss the interpunction and work with the macro recorder. Later you will write your own more complex macro …for the provided example… 

**Goals**: 




## structure lesson
Example: why macro’s. can be very simple to very complex. All repetitive actions can be handled faster by a macro. (5 min)

commands: interpunction of ImageJ, website with basic commands, recorder


some very easy example
some playing with recorder. (total 10 min)


a for loop/while loop



Make your own bigger one. My example. break down in steps. 
including saving data to cvs. or stack as gif.





debugging: how to. let op: geen variables saved. Always start from the top.
good practice to also test it on a second data set.. Include comments per step. 





## voor mij: Werkt het op ImageJ en FIJI hetzelfde???
